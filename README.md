Basically a prototype of a card game for some time in the future. 

Main purpose is to create a completely usable, working, playable and fun
card game, as similar in functionality to it's future implementation. Overall
structure will be defined with this prototype, as well as balance, and other
practice with the code.

This was programmed mostly in Vanilla JS. It also uses some really new tech like 
Flexbox and WebRTC DataChannels, so for now browser support is limited to:

- Latest Firefox
- Latest Chrome
- Latest Opera

### Basic Rules

Opponents face off against one another with their decks. One is attacker, the other 
defender. They alternate playing cards, trying to have the stronger squad on field. Full rules 
are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_F8nJnIw4iQ41A3Ck53LpAcom_8wTxXLTzWX6hG-8XA/edit?usp=sharing).
